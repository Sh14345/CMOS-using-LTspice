# CMOS-using-LTspice
This repository contains a CMOS inverter circuit designed and simulated using LTspice. A CMOS inverter which is actually a "Hello World" in VLSI design logic  is a fundamental building block in digital electronics, and this project aims to showcase its operation and characteristics.
